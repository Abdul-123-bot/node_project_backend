# BOSS (Backend Operations Service System)

### Introduction:
BOSS is defined as Backend Operations Service System. It is an inventory management tool providing comprehensive features such as  Add/Delete/Update Items, Purchase Items, Feedback on Items, Product Delivery, Product Shipment Estimate Time, and Goods Received.
*	Add/Update/Delete Items: Adding new items in the inventory, adjusting the existing stock in the inventory and deleting them.
*	Purchase Items: Customer can purchase items from the store.
*	Feedback on Items: Customer can provide feedback on the items brought from the store.
*	Product Delivery: Product can be delivered from the store to the place where the customer requires it to get delivered.
*	Product Shipment Estimate Time: BOSS provides an estimate time for the shipment to reach the customer.
*	Goods received: Markdown the inventory received from the vendor.

### BOSS Intstallation:
To get started with running this project locally, follow the instructions below:

**Prerequisites:**

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) - [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Git - [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- MongoDB - [Download and install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- React - [Create React App](https://react.dev/learn/installation)

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdul-123-bot/node_project_backend/

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
      cd node_project

3. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
      cd backend
   
4. Install dependencies for the server (Node.js):
   
   ```bash
      npm install
5. Navigate to the client directory (React):

   ```bash
      cd front-end
   
6. Install dependencies for the client (React):

   ```bash
      npm install

**Running the Application:**
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the server and client applications separately.

**Server (Node.js):**
From the root directory of the project:


The server will start running at http://localhost:5000.

**Client (React):**
From the client/ directory:
      


**Getting Started with the front-end part:**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The BOSS project, built on React, is a powerful inventory management system that streamlines your business operations. Leveraging the flexibility and performance of React, the application offers a seamless user experience, enabling efficient management of sales, purchases, deliveries, goods received, stock counts, and comprehensive reporting.
**Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

**Technologies Used in Our Project:**
**Front-End Technologies**
1) HTML-Hypertext Markup Language. In our Project, HTML is used to define the structure and content of web pages, including headers, paragraphs, lists, and other elements. It works in conjunction with CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity, creating a dynamic user interface. HTML forms are essential for collecting user input, which is then processed on the server-side using server-side technologies.
2) CSS - Cascading Style Sheets. In our project, CSS was used to define fonts, colors, layouts, and other visual aspects of HTML elements. CSS enables creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces by providing techniques for expanding and collapsing content It is an important technique in modern web development, which allowed us to build dynamic and responsive user experiences.
3) React- It is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language. JavaScript is the most widely used programming language for client-side scripting in web development, and it is also increasingly used on the server-side with Node.js. Its versatility and ubiquity make it an essential tool for modern web development.
**Back-end Technologies**
1)Node.js - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that we used to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is designed for building scalable network applications using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and well-suited for data-intensive real-time applications. 
2)Express.js - Express.js is a popular and minimalist Node.js web application framework that simplifies the process of building server-side applications and APIs.It has become the de facto standard for building back-end applications with Node.js, as it makes easier to create scalable and efficient server-side solutions with JavaScript. 
3)Javascript - JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has a wide range of features, including variables, data types, operators, control flow, and functions. We have used it in the client-side scripting in web development, and it is also increasingly used on the server-side with Node.js.
**Database Technology**
Mongo DB - MongoDB is a popular, open-source, document-oriented database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for dynamic schemas. MongoDB supports features like ad-hoc queries, indexing, and real-time aggregation, making it well-suited for modern web applications.
