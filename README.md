# Getting Started

To get started with running this project locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) - [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Git - [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- MongoDB - [Download and install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- React - [Create React App](https://react.dev/learn/installation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdul-123-bot/node_project_backend/

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
      cd node_project

3. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
      cd backend
   
4. Install dependencies for the server (Node.js):
   
   ```bash
      npm install
5. Navigate to the client directory (React):

   ```bash
      cd front-end
   
6. Install dependencies for the client (React):

   ```bash
      npm install

#Running the Application
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the server and client applications separately.

##Server (Node.js)
From the root directory of the project:


The server will start running at http://localhost:5000.

#Client (React)
From the client/ directory:
      


# Getting Started with the front-end part:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The BOSS project, built on React, is a powerful inventory management system that streamlines your business operations. Leveraging the flexibility and performance of React, the application offers a seamless user experience, enabling efficient management of sales, purchases, deliveries, goods received, stock counts, and comprehensive reporting.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
